# Canada-Map-R-Visualization-for-Election-Data
<h4>{Project done for UBC/DATA 501}</h4>
<br>
<p>Designed an interactive geo-spatial visualization where Canadaâ€™s territories/provinces will be color-coded by their choice of parties in a selected election year and some other necessary, meaningful data can be represented in an effective manner through visually formatted information.</p>

<p>Elections data has many applications; we can analyze the data and search for trends by looking at party support over time, or the geographic trends of party support within for future election. A scraper was developed to scrape through "Canadian Elections Databese" to accumulate the information of all the past Federal and Provincial Election. Details about the scraper can be found in the following link: https://github.com/Mohammad-Abdul-Hadi/scraper-for-canadianelectionsdatabase.ca</p>

  <li><h3><u>Summary of the data</u></h3></li>
  <p>For the project, a composite database has been used which will be comprised of two datasets of the same domain (Canadian Federal Election): one form <i>Kaggle</i> (data from 1997 to 2015) and another from <i>Sayers, 2017</i> (data from 1867 to 2015). Details of these datasets are mentioned below:</p>
